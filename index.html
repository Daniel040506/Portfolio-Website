            <div class="infoText">
                I am a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia. I recently completed my 2nd year of studies, and am moving into my 3rd year this September.
                Throughout my years in High School and University, I have pursued a plethora of academic and personal projects related to software, web, and game development, and I 
                have considerable insight into all 3 fields. I am currently looking to find a co-op internship for my first co-op term, and I am open to many different avenues and
                fields of software to do so.

        <H4>Interactive Calculator Website</H4>
        <div class="infoText">
            A fully functional, stylized interactive calculator website. This project furthered my competency with JavaScript,
            both in terms of integration with the webpage (Using events and listeners) as well as handling conflicts relating to 
            expected datatypes (parsing strings and numbers and accounting for overlap). The CSS styling on the website was carefully planned,
            with a clean, minimalist aesthetic as the intention.

        <H4>Interactive Drawing Website</H4>
        <div class="infoText">
            This is a small project I have worked on while developing my skills and competencies in web development.
            It is an interactive web application designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the interactive components.
            In creating this project, I learned extensively about DOM manipulation, how to create dynamic events using event listeners,
            and how to make large portions of a website generated through Javascript code.

        <div class="infoText">
            A work in progress website I intend to update frequently as I become more proficient in web development. 
            Currently, it uses HTML and Javascript to simulate a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. 
            In the future, I plan to add more interactive games such as tic-tac-toe, and hangman.

        <H4>3D Exploration Game (Unity)</H4>
        <div class="infoText">
            My largest and most developed game I have worked on. It is a first-person exploration game developed in Unity.
            I created custom scripts, assets, and level design to create a game with a unique atmosphere. My main inspirations were 
            indie horror games from the 2010s, such as Slender, and Amnesia, as I intended to create an unsettling feeling when exploring the areas.
            In the future, games I create will further expand on this idea, and I may pursue this development in Godot to expand my skills to other game engines.

        <H4>Quiz Creator</H4>
        <div class="infoText">
            The purpose of this project is to develop an application to create and use short quizzes as a tool for studying. 
            The main function of the program is to add quiz questions and then later practice using them. 
            The intended user for this program is someone like a student, trying to create study materials for an exam, or an instructor trying to provide study resources for their students. 
            Some of the functionality I have implemented in this project includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Fully function CLI usage, allowing users to create, and practice quiz questions</li>
                <li>Functional save and load system writing to and reading from JSON Files</li>
                <li>GUI interface for interacting with many functions of the program, such as creating/removing questions, saving and loading collections of questions</li>
            </ul>
